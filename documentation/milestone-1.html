<h1><strong>Construction Dummies Purpose, Audience, and Goals</strong></h1>
<br>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this website is to create a functioning website for my friends construction business. I would like to connect the audience to a local service with local people.<p>
<p>Construction Dummies is a business that specializes in commercial/residential clean outs, demolition, junk haul, and new construction clean up. This company is still fairly new and only operates from small social media pages and word of mouth. </p>
<p>Once the website is created the goal is to bring more awareness to the company/brand which will hopefully bring more business to the company.</p>
<br>
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>The main audience for the site is potential customers who most likely own a home or property and are looking for destruction/clean up services, also looking to support local small businesses.</p>
<p>The site will have a simple design and interaction interface as to not scare away customers who are taking a leap in trusting a small business.</p>
<p>I will also use this website to show future potential employers that I am capable of coding a functional website</p>
<br>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal of this website is to get the Construction Dummies name out into the webpage world, it will attract new customers which will increase sales.</p>
<p>This website will also have links to the small social media sites to attract more followers to grow the brand even more.</p>
<p>The website will also have images of before and after photos of jobs that have been completed to serve as a sort of gallery to showcase the good work that is done.</p>
